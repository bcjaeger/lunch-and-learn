## R is glue

S was originally developed so that statisticians at Bell labs could run their Fortran scripts interactively.

- R additionally supports interface to C/C++ and Java.

- R packages can generate code and run it in other languages such as 

    + html, e.g., [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), example [here](https://bcjaeger.shinyapps.io/DPE4NHTN_WebApp/)
    
    + css, e.g., [minicss](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2019/09/11/introducing-the-minicss-package-for-creating-css-styles-and-stylesheets-in-r/)
    
    + SQL, e.g., [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/sql.html)


And if you use Rstudio,

- The [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package allows you to run python from R.

- The [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package allows you to run git commands from R

## ggplot2

- based on the book:</br>[Grammar of Graphics][gg-book]. 

- You provide the data,</br>tell ggplot2 how to map</br>variables to aesthetics,</br>what geometry</br>to use, and it takes</br>care of the details.

## Data

Data without a mapping is just a blank plot.

```{r}

p <- ggplot(data = penguins)

p

```

---

## Mapping

```{r}
p <- p +
 aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species) 

p

```

---

## Geometries


```{r}
p <- p +
 geom_point()

p

```



---

## Facets

```{r}
p <- p +
 facet_wrap(~island)

p

```

---

## Statistics

```{r}
p <- p +
 stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

p

```

---

## Coordinates

```{r}
p <- p +
 labs(x = "Flipper length, mm", y = "Bill length, mm")

p

```


---

## Theme (pre-built)

```{r}
p <- p +
 theme_bw()

p

```

---

## Theme (custom)

```{r}
p <- p +
 theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

p

```

---

## Flair

```{r}
p <- p + 
 scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))

p

```

## Learning ggplot2

If you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual documentation pages. Currently, there are three good places to start:

1.  The [Data Visualisation][r4ds-vis] and
    [Graphics for communication][r4ds-comm] chapters in 
    [R for Data Science][r4ds]. R for Data Science is designed to
    give you a comprehensive introduction to the
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), and these two chapters will
    get you up to speed with the essentials of ggplot2 as quickly as 
    possible.
    
1.  If you'd like to take an online course, try
    [Data Visualization in R With ggplot2][oreilly] by Kara Woo.
    
1.  If you'd like to follow a webinar, try
    [Plotting Anything with ggplot2](https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68) by Thomas Lin 
    Pedersen.

1.  If you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly 
    as possible, I recommend [The R Graphics Cookbook][cookbook] 
    by Winston Chang. It provides a set of recipes to solve common
    graphics problems.

## Rmarkdown

The "R Markdown" format was first introduced in early 2012 by the knitr package.

The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or other languages) into Markdown documents.

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) allowed conversion of Markdown documents (and many other types of documents) to a variety of output formats.

R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. 

- knitr executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. 

- pandoc renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF [LaTeX], HTML, Word, and so on)

## Function composition

---

## Long chains of functions?

Let's say we start with `x`, our input value.

- then compute `f(x)`, 

- and then pass the output of that into `t()`, 

- and pass the output of that to `w()`.

--

Here is what that looks like in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

w(t(f(x)))

```

--

Is this readable? 

No. You have to start at the end to read the order of operations correctly.

How can we make the code more friendly to humans?

## Pipes

- R version 4.1 introduced the base pipe, `|>`.

- (There is another pipe operator, `%>%`, that is almost the same as `|>`.)

The pipe passes output from one function into another, e.g.:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

x |>     # start with x, then
 f() |>  # apply f() to x, then
 t() |>  # apply t to f(x), then
 w()     # apply w to t(f(x))

```

Why is this readable?

- The pipe has a fairly intuitive meaning: 'then'

- Your eyes move from left to right, top to bottom

- Less complexity per line

## Projects

One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis the next day. 

One day you will be working on multiple analyses simultaneously that all use R and you want to keep them separate. 

R experts keep all the files associated with a project together:

- input data, 

- R scripts, 

- analytical results, 

- figures. 

This is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects.

Instead of making slides about it, I will take you on a demo of the project where I made this presentation.
